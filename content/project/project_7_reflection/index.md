## Directions
This website contains every completed project from this Independent Study. Each project page includes all the information needed to understand the project, including background, process, and future steps. The code that is not displayed on the website is available within one of the github repositories. I refer to multiple because there are two. I realized the need when cleaning everything else up, the fact that the original repository was populated entirely with files needed for the website meant that finding anything else was far too difficult. Becuase I feared ruining all file paths if I put all of said files in a sub folder, I decided to create a second repo to contain the rest.

## Reflections (Self eval)

This independent study aimed to cover a number of different R coding skills through a series of small projects focusing on each one. Initially, I aimed to gain the following skills: A capability with using statistics in R sufficient for competence in biological field science, competence creating visualizations that employ both spatial data and animation, and fluency in working with the RShiny package. In the event of extra time, I hoped to gain a comprehensive understanding of the basics of interpolation and its application in R, as well as competence in website development using R. 

The biggest question going into this process for me was centered around how this independent study format would influence my learning as compared to a class. Generally, I can certainly say that it was beneficial for me, but it obviously gets more complicated than that. Having a format that supported my own motivation was really beneficial. Being able to get into the flow of a project and work though it at my own speed made up a strong portion of the code that I ended up writing. The other real benefit was in the flexibility that I had due to the self directed nature of this project. I had set out the above learning goals as a structure, but as I went I found it important to restructure as I learned about myself and my projects to follow topics I was motivated to work on and which were a better use of my time. For instance, the project centering around spatial data animation never came to fruition. As I though through it, I realized that the specific case in which I was excited to work, an animation of Freeland Bunker's journaled location, would require a significant amount of manual work in matching coordinates to locations, and decided that my time was better suited elsewhere. A similar situation occurred with my Statistics project. After a substantial amount of learning, I concluded that no matter how much I learned during this project, I would need to take a class on the topic in order to achieve the level of comprehension that I was seeking. As such, I put that project on pause in favor of taking Intro to Stats next term. These subtractive changes made room for projects that I found myself eager to pursue partway through the term. I learned a great deal from both the data set building project and the data scraping project, both of which presented themselves during the independent study. This process would not have been possible in an ordinary class, and I am grateful for being able to experience it. My mind tends to pick up and drop ideas very quickly, and this learning style supported that process instead of working against it, a situation which often leaves me entirely unmotivated.

This lack of structure did have its drawbacks though. Structure does well to help me manage my time well, and as I quickly diverted from my original plan to begin my Statistics work, I left the support behind. If I were to do this again, I would update my plan as I make changes as to ensure that I have a schedule to stick to. Without it, I found myself floundering on a couple of occations with lack of pressure to keep moving forward. By building some structure in the form of arbitrary deadlines back up, I was able to move past these points of immobility. 

As just highlighted, this Independent Study was not without its points of struggle, but upon reflection and comparison to previous classes, I see this study to be extremely successful. 

In the end, I gained:
- Experience building complex functions and working with the StringR package
- Comprehension of basic statistical principles and the ability to implement them in R with descriptive statistics and modeling
- Increased fluency in web scraping and using data science in conjunction with unrelated pursuits
- A reinforced understanding of the importance of keeping good data, and methods to achieve that
- The ability to build a website using Rblogdown, Hugo, and Netlify
- Substantially more understanding and fluency in building and hosting RShiny apps

## Projections

At the end of each of the project pages, I have included my thoughts on how each project will impact my future work, even if I don't intend to continue that project in particular. I have been quite happy to find that many of these efforts have opened up inspiration and opportunities to continue learning, and I intend to pursue as many of them as I can. One that really got away from me this term was the interpolation project. I chose to list it as an extra project that would be completed if I had time, but I was still quite looking forward to work on it, and was disappointed that I never got the time to tackle it. That is one that I will most certainly be working toward in the future, especially with the ability to talk a bit with Greg Britten about his work.
