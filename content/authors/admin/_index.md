This is the home page for my Independent Study: R 4 Human Ecology.
Each project I pursue will be detailed here, along with products and reflections.

## Goals
  This independent study serves to learn new skills using the programming language R, while also reinforcing previously learned skills that can use practice. These skills will follow the theme of being applicable for uses in various aspects of human ecology that I would like to pursue, such as biological statistics, spatial visualization, and citizen science.

  To do this, I will be following a series of projects that I am separately hoping to pursue which require new skills. These projects will include a crash course on statistics and its use with R to analyze whale stranding data and Storm Petrels, which I would like to continue working on in terms past this project; a deeper dive into spatial data and animation to create a location animation based on the historical Freeland Bunker Journals, a project using similar skills in a modern scientific context to create location based animations using data from the NERACOOS network, and a deep dive into RShiny to create a data entry application for citizen science entry during vernal migration of amphibians. 

  If I end up completing these faster than anticipated, I will also learn data interpolation while working with CTD data and start an exploration of website building in R to create a website to host the product of the previous project and related information, as well as a website to host my photography portfolio.
